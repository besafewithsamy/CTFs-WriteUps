# CTFs-WriteUps

My personal collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) write-ups from:

- Hack The Box
- TryHackMe
- Other labs and challenges

This repository documents my methodology, tools, and step-by-step exploitation process for learning, practice, and reference.

---

## Methodology

Each write-up generally follows this workflow:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Enumeration
3. Exploitation
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Flags & Lessons Learned
